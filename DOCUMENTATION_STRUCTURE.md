- Deep dives available when needed

### 4. Redundancy by Design
- Critical information appears in multiple places
- Quick Reference duplicates essential items
- Reduces single point of failure

### 5. Action-Oriented
- Checklists throughout
- Step-by-step procedures
- Clear next actions
- Timeline-based organization
